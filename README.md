# XO Game – Step-by-Step Docker Compose Tutorial

## Overview

This project is a single-player Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) game built with Node.js and PostgreSQL. You’ll learn how to run it using Docker Compose, which sets up both the app and its database in isolated containers.

---

## What You Need

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd XO-Game
```

---

## Step 2: Understand the Containers and Images

This app uses **two containers** defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

1. **xo-game-app**
   - **Image:** Built from the included `Dockerfile` (uses `node:18-alpine` as the base image)
   - **Runs:** The Node.js Express backend and serves the frontend

2. **xo-game-db**
   - **Image:** `postgres:15-alpine` (official PostgreSQL image)
   - **Runs:** The PostgreSQL database

---

## Step 3: What’s the Difference? Dockerfile vs docker-compose.yml

- **Dockerfile:**  
  Describes how to build a single image (for the app).  
  Example: It says “start from Node.js, copy my code, install dependencies, set up the app.”

- **docker-compose.yml:**  
  Describes how to run multiple containers together.  
  Example: It says “run my app container AND a database container, connect them, set environment variables, map ports, etc.”

**In short:**  
- Use a **Dockerfile** to build an image for one service.  
- Use **docker-compose.yml** to run and connect multiple containers as a complete stack.

---

## Step 4: Build and Start the App

From your project directory, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

- `--build` ensures the app image is rebuilt with your latest code.
- `-d` runs everything in the background.

---

## Step 5: Access the App

- Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

You’ll see the XO Game interface. Play a game, and results/stats will appear at the bottom.

---

## Step 6: Stopping and Restarting

- **Stop everything:**  
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
- **Restart everything:**  
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

---

## Step 7: How It Works

- The **app container** runs your Node.js code and talks to the database.
- The **db container** stores all game results in PostgreSQL.
- Docker Compose makes sure both containers are started and connected on a private network.

---

## Step 8: Customizing

- To change the app port, edit the `ports` section in `docker-compose.yml`.
- To reset the database, you can remove the volume in Docker Compose (be careful, this deletes all data):

  ```bash
  docker-compose down -v
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see a port error, make sure nothing else is running on port 4000.
- To see logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs app
  docker-compose logs db
  ```

---

## Summary Table

| Container Name | Image Used         | Purpose                | Exposed Port |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| xo-game-app    | Built from Dockerfile (node:18-alpine) | Node.js/Express app | 4000         |
| xo-game-db     | postgres:15-alpine | PostgreSQL database    | 5432         |

---

## That’s It!

You now have a fully containerized XO Game app running with Docker Compose.  
If you want to add features or change the stack, just edit the code and re-run `docker-compose up --build`.

This guide explains how to set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js project using GitHub Actions and Render. It covers the three main stages (Build, Test, Deploy), how to configure deployment to Render using a deploy hook, and how to verify your deployment.

---

## 1. Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of **three stages**:

1. **Build Stage**: Installs dependencies and prepares the application for deployment.
2. **Test Stage**: Runs automated tests and health checks to ensure code quality.
3. **Deploy Stage**: Triggers a deployment to Render using a secure deploy hook.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository for your Node.js project
- A [Render](https://render.com/) account
- Your app set up as a Render Web Service (Node.js)

---

## 3. Step-by-Step CI/CD Setup

### Step 1: Create a Render Web Service
1. Log in to [Render](https://render.com/)
2. Click **New +** → **Web Service**
3. Connect your GitHub repo and select your project
4. Set the build command: `npm install`
5. Set the start command: `npm start`
6. Complete the setup and deploy your service

### Step 2: Get Render Deploy Hook
1. In your Render service dashboard, go to **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Deploy Hooks**
3. Copy ** Deploy Hook**

### Step 3: Add the Deploy Hook to GitHub Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK`
4. Value: (Paste your Render deploy hook URL)
5. Click **Add secret**

### Step 4: Add the CI/CD Workflow File
1. In your repo, create `.github/workflows/three-stage.yml` with the following structure:

```yaml
name: 3-Stage CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Stage
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

          npm start &
          SERVER_PID=$!
          for i in {1..30}; do
            if curl -f http://localhost:3000/health > /dev/null 2>&1; then
              echo "Server is ready!"
              break
            fi
            sleep 2
          done
          curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
          kill $SERVER_PID || true
          wait $SERVER_PID 2>/dev/null || true
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: dist/
      - name: Test built application
        run: |
          cd dist
          npm start &
          SERVER_PID=$!
          for i in {1..30}; do
            if curl -f http://localhost:3000/health > /dev/null 2>&1; then
              echo "Built server is ready!"
              break
            fi
            sleep 2
          done
          curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
          kill $SERVER_PID || true
          wait $SERVER_PID 2>/dev/null || true

  deploy:
    name: Deploy to Render
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Render Deploy Hook
        run: |
          curl -X POST "$RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK"
        env:
          RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK: ${{ secrets.RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK }}
      - name: Notify deployment success
        run: |
          echo "🚀 Successfully triggered Render deployment!"
          echo "Application is live at: https://your-app.onrender.com/"
```

## 4. How to Check Deployment Status

### A. On GitHub Actions
- Go to your repo → **Actions** tab
- Click on the latest workflow run
- Ensure all three stages (Build, Test, Deploy) are green

### B. On Render
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Open your service
- Check the **Events** tab for deployment status
- You should see a new deployment triggered by the deploy hook

### C. Using the Deploy Hook
- The deploy step in your workflow triggers the deploy hook via `curl`
- You can also manually trigger a deployment by running:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "<your-render-deploy-hook-url>"
  ```
- This will start a new deployment on Render

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Malformed input to a URL function**: Check that your `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` secret is set correctly and contains the full URL.
- **Deployment not triggered**: Make sure the deploy hook is correct and your workflow references the secret properly.
- **Build or test failures**: Check the logs in the Actions tab for details.

---

## 6. Summary

- Set up your Render service and deploy hook
- Add the deploy hook as a GitHub secret
- Use the provided workflow for a 3-stage CI/CD pipeline
- Every push to `main` will build, test, and deploy your app to Render automatically
